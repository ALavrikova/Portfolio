					<div id="avocadoInfo" class="veggieInfo"><p>The avocado (Persea americana) is a tree long thought to have originated in South Central Mexico, classified as a member of the flowering plant family Lauraceae. Recent archaeological research produced evidence that the avocado was present in Peru as long as 8,000 to 15,000 years ago. Avocado (also alligator pear) refers to the tree's fruit, which is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed.Avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and Mediterranean climates throughout the world. They have a green-skinned, fleshy body that may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or spherical. Commercially, they ripen after harvesting. Avocado trees are partially self-pollinating and are often propagated through grafting to maintain a predictable quality and quantity of the fruit.</p></div>

					<div id="beetsInfo" class="veggieInfo"><p>The beetroot is the taproot portion of the beet plant, usually known in North America as the beet, also table beet, garden beet, red beet, or golden beet. It is one of several of the cultivated varieties of Beta vulgaris grown for their edible taproots and their leaves (called beet greens). These varieties have been classified as B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris Conditiva Group.From the Middle Ages, beetroot was used as a treatment for a variety of conditions, especially illnesses relating to digestion and the blood. Bartolomeo Platina recommended taking beetroot with garlic to nullify the effects of "garlic-breath".During the middle of the 19th century wine often was coloured with beetroot juice.Beta is the ancient Latin name for beets, possibly of Celtic origin, becoming bete in Old English around 1400.</p></div>

					<div id="potatoInfo" class="veggieInfo"><p>The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanum tuberosum. The word "potato" may refer either to the plant itself or to the edible tuber. In the Andes, where the species is indigenous, some other closely related species are cultivated. Potatoes were introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish.Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas from the United States to southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated independently in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species proved a single origin for potatoes in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia (from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex).</p></div>
